# MPU6050_WLED

Developed by William Lucid with an assist from OpenAI's ChatGPT 02/24/2023.  Only partially finished; 
has not been added directly to running WLED, project is a work-in-progress.  Will need a usermod to be 
added and compiled for WLED.  Sketch was developed to generate varialbles for effects, Intensity, and 
color palette variables of WLED project.  [WLED Project:](https://kno.wled.ge/)  WLED runs on ESP8266 or 
ESP32.

[WLED "List of Effects and Palettes":](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/List-of-effects-and-palettes) 

Plan is to use a wand/paddle with the MPU6050 attached; user could "wave" the wand/paddle effecting changes 
to strip led, WLED "effects," "intensity," and "color Palette."
