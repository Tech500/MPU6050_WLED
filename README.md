# MPU6050_WLED

Latest version; "MPU6050_WLED_withThree_Switches_0800.ino" no longer uses touch features; instead, it uses three switches for better user interface. Features are nearly the same.  Find the latest version in the folder: MPU6050_WLED_withThree_Switches. Note: must use the new variables.h file; as variable names have changed. First time use; edit variable values to match your network nd configuration. Version date 03/30/2023 0800 EDT

Developed by William Lucid with an assist from OpenAI's ChatGPT.  Only partially finished; 
has not been added directly to running WLED, project is a work-in-progress.  Will need a usermod to be 
added and compiled for WLED.  Sketch was developed to generate varialbles for effects, Intensity, and 
color palette variables of WLED project.  [WLED Project](https://kno.wled.ge/)  WLED runs on ESP8266 or 
ESP32.

[WLED "List of Effects and Palettes"](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/List-of-effects-and-palettes) 

Plan is to use a wand/paddle with the MPU6050 attached; user could "wave" the wand/paddle effecting changes 
to strip led, WLED "effects," "intensity," and "color Palette."

Using MPU6050_WLED. Project:
1.  Requires WLED Controller, ESP32, MPU6050
2.  Touching both wires; generates URLs using data from MPU6050. Touching T4 (GPIO13) wire; release T5 (GPIO12) wire; URLs generated by random data.  
     Release both wires; ESP32 goes to deep sleep.
