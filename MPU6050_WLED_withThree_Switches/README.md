Latest version no longer uses touch features; instead, it uses three switches for better user interface. Features are nearly the same. Find the latest version in the folder: MPU6050_WLED_withThree_Switches. Note: must use the new variables.h file; as variable names have changed. First time use; edit variable values to match your network nd configuration. Version date 03/30/2023 0800 EDT

Developed by William Lucid with assist from OpenAI's ChatGPT.  Only partially finished; 
has not been added directly to running WLED, project is a work-in-progress.  Will need a usermod to be 
added and compiled for WLED.  Sketch was developed to generate varialbles to send WLED Controller for effects using MPU6050. Generating Effects, Intensity, and 
color palette variables of WLED project.  [WLED Project](https://kno.wled.ge/)  WLED tested and runs on ESP32.

[WLED "List of Effects and Palettes"](https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/List-of-effects-and-palettes) 

Plan is to use a wand/paddle with the MPU6050 attached; user could "wave" the wand/paddle effecting changes 
to strip led, WLED "effects," "intensity," and "color Palette."

Using MPU6050_WLED. Project:
1.  Requires WLED Controller, ESP32, MPU6050
2.  Read "Operation of Switches.pdf" for switch operation.
